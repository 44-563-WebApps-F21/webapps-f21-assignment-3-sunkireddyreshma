        Saoirse Ronan stars in Greta Gerwig's directorial debut as an opinionated Catholic school student who lives out her final year before college in the way one should: crushing on the cool boys, lying about how much money her family has in order to fit in, and clashing with her mom. In fact, it's Lady Bird's complicated relationship with her mom, Marie, that makes the movie what it is. It's fraught and loving all at once, and the two butt heads in just about every scene, only to make up just as quickly.
