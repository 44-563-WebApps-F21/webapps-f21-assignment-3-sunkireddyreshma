    <h4> The Silver Snoopy</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Snoopy is a major character in the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz.
    </li>
    <li>A running gag within the strip is that he does a "happyï»¿ dance", 
        which annoys Lucy because she believes that nobody can ever be that happy.
    </li>
    <li>That name was already being used in a comic strip, though, so Charles changed it when he remembered his 
        mother saying that if they ever got another family dog, it would be named Snoopy
    </li>
